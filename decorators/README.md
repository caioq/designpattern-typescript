## Decorator

A decorator is an experimental Typescript feature that allows us to annotate classes, methods and properties in order to extend their functionality without the need to subclass them.
If you attempt to use decorators in Typescript, they won't work out of the box. You have to enable two fields in yout tsconfig.json file.

## To test locally

```
npm run ts-node app
